This is an extension to [EMI](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/emi), the featureful and accessible item and recipe viewer for Minecraft. It shows [BlockGame](https://blockgame.info/) vendor recipes. That's all it's supposed to do.

## Contributing and support

Pull requests are welcome. I am no Java dev. I may lose interest in the project at any time, in that event I will announce it and may pass it on to reliable people who want to continue it.
