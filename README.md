# EMI Ma BlockGame

This mod is an extension to [EMI](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/emi), the featureful and accessible item and recipe viewer for Minecraft. It shows [BlockGame](https://blockgame.info/) vendor recipes and items. That's all it's supposed to do.

## Disclaimer

This is not associated in any official way with [BlockGame](https://blockgame.info/), its merely a fan creation.

## Features

Makes learned [Blockgame Journal](https://modrinth.com/mod/blockgame-journal) recipes show up in EMI.

- [Blockgame Journal](https://modrinth.com/mod/blockgame-journal)

## Contributing and support

Pull requests are welcome. I am no _Java_ dev. (May rewrite it in Rust later... ðŸ¦€)

### TODOs

- Items
  - Gold (money)
- Dynamically update EMI
  - Create and register EMI items that are learned
    - IMPORTANT: is it even possible to dynamically do this?
  - Create categories for each vendor
  - Register recipes
